1. Define the Structure:
A structure student is defined, which includes:
A pointer name for storing the student's name dynamically.
An integer rollno for storing the student's roll number.
A float marks for storing the student's marks.
2. Allocate Memory for Name:
Using malloc, the program allocates memory for the name field. This allows for flexible handling of string sizes.
3. Input Student Details:
The program prompts the user to enter the student's name, roll number, and marks.
It uses fgets to read the name, ensuring it can handle spaces.
4. Process Input:
After reading the name, the program removes any trailing newline character that may be included by fgets.
5. Display Student Details:
The program then prints the entered details in a formatted manner.
6. Free Allocated Memory:
Finally, it frees the dynamically allocated memory for the name to prevent memory leaks.
