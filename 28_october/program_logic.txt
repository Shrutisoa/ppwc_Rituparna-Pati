Step (a): Multiplying the Product
1. Input: User inputs item = 4.
2. Logic:
Check if item is non-zero: 4 != 0 (true).
Multiply product (initially 1) by item: product = 1 * 4 = 4.
3. Output: Print Product: 4.
Step (b): Absolute Difference
1. Input: User inputs x = 8 and y = 3.
2. Logic:
Compare x and y: Since 8 > 3, calculate 8 - 3.
Update y: y = 8 - 3 = 5.
3. Output: Print Absolute difference (stored in y): 5.
Step (c): Counting and Summing Based on x
1. Input: User inputs x = -2.
2. Logic:
Check if x is 0: -2 == 0 (false).
Check if x is negative: -2 < 0 (true).
Update minus_sum: minus_sum = 0 + (-2) = -2.
3. Output: Print:
Zero count: 0 (remains unchanged).
Minus sum: -2.
Plus sum: 0 (remains unchanged).
Final Output
After all steps, the output would look like this:
Product: 4
Absolute difference (stored in y): 5
Zero count: 0
Minus sum: -2
Plus sum: 0
